# Web Development Resources

Some good resources that are around for people looking to learn the basics or beyond-the-basics of frontend web development

## Courses

* In-person
  * [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/) has great workshops for learning web development principles.
  * [HackerYou](https://hackeryou.com) offers bootcamp and lots of part-time and weekend options for courses

* Online
  * The [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) is one of the best ways I can think of to get an introduction to JavaScript. Wes Bos is a great teacher and a really great personality amongst developers. Plus, it's free.
  * I've had good luck with courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), but check the reviews for one you're interested in and make sure the people who've taken it are happy with it.
  * There are paid options available from sites like [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and free options like [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
  * [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is also a good option if you want something fast
  * [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/) is advanced, but very good for an intermediate developer.
  * There's some good stuff on [EdX](https://www.edx.org), but one I've tried and really enjoyed was Harvard's [CS50 Intro to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)


## Books

* O'Reilly makes generally the best books on web development I've seen, but there are other good companies.
* [Learning Web Design](https://www.amazon.ca/Learning-Web-Design-Beginners-JavaScript/dp/1449319270) by Jennifer Robbins was a book I had when I started learning and it's a great 'from-the-start' kind of an introduction
* [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a classic, and available both for free online and paid as a book if you prefer
* [Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery](https://www.amazon.ca/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=pd_sim_14_2/135-8639174-5034444?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1118907442&pd_rd_r=57f1584b-5187-11e9-88de-bdc5d031db6a&pd_rd_w=PHGEL&pd_rd_wg=jC90R&pf_rd_p=29a85b27-a36a-4f8d-94ca-61aa962c5f39&pf_rd_r=EYRGSPPSJWAFBKSA4WXW&psc=1&refRID=EYRGSPPSJWAFBKSA4WXW) is another set that is supposed to be good for the beginner
* A lot of books can be taken out from the [Library](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?Ntt=html+css+javascript), which is one of my favorite things about the city.
* You Don't Know JS is a great series - the [whole thing is up on Github](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) or you can find a copy of the first book, which is an introduction to programming in JavaScript.
* Occasionally, ebook bundles will be available from [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) but the quality can sometimes be inconsistent and the material can be very specific, so double check and make sure that the titles are what you're looking to learn

## Online Resources

* O'Reilly has a platform called Safari for looking at their books online. It's [available through the TPL](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?R=EDB0099). Here's a [suggested reading list](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-good-resources-for-learning-about-javascript) from them
